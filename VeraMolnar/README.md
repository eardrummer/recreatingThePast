Vera Molnar
Recreating the Past – Manaswi

I choose the following piece to work on recreating.

Title: Dialog Between Emotion and Method
Year: 1986
 

Observations:
•	6 by 6 grid of individual units on a black background.
•	Each unit has an assigned color (From a fixed dictionary of colors – Red, Green, Purple, Yellow, Blue, dark blue/Violet)
•	Each unit is made of multiple (fixed number? About 8 to 10) connected quadrilaterals (of sorts) all the same color with a wide range of values for the corners. (not completely random, because every unit has a large variance or corner positions)
•	Counting the number of colors, most colors occur 4-5 times, except dark blue/violet which occurs 9 times.
•	The neighboring units are overlapping to an extent (So the underlying grid should allow a tolerable overlap)


Ideas to parameterize:
•	Density of grids, density of quadrilaterals
•	Animation of the squares being drawn in order to show the method
•	Animation of colors being added and modified in order to show the emotion
•	Trying to think about the piece as a Dialog between “method” and “emotion”
•	Look for process/method videos/essays in which Vera talks about this piece.
